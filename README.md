# WEC S25 Programming Repository



## Key Notes
Before touching anything in this repo make sure to read your package to get a clear understanding of what
needs to be achieved. Please fork this repository and name yours in the format: group<group #>WECProgrammingS25.


There are sample input.txt files provided in this repository but they are not sufficient to test the effectiveness of 
your solution.

I have also provided sample code in both pythan and javascript to read .txt files
and create .json files. Please refer to them as you need.

Before the competition time runs out, make sure to make a final commit to your
master branch with your completed code. This is what I will use to test against
my inputs.

### Good Luck!!
